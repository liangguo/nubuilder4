nuBuilder is the world's best: open-source, low-code application builder.

== Description ==

nuBuilder enables you to make any application that want or need with the least amount of effort and the least amount of learning.

nuBuilder Forte is the 4th version of nuBuilder. A browser-based tool created by nuSoftware for developing web-based database applications.

nuBuilder uses either MySQL or Maria DB databases and gives its users the ability to do database operations like: 
* Search
* Create
* Insert
* Read
* Update
* Delete

nuBuilder is a enterprise level application builder but with no limitations on database size or CPU usage.
